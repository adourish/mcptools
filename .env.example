# This project uses environments.json for API key configuration
# The OpenRouter API key should be added to your environments.json file:
#
# {
#   "environments": {
#     "openrouter": {
#       "credentials": {
#         "apiKey": "your_api_key_here"
#       }
#     },
#     "todoist": {
#       "credentials": {
#         "apiToken": "your_todoist_token_here"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# Get your OpenRouter API key from: https://openrouter.ai/keys
# Note: environments.json is already in .gitignore and should never be committed
